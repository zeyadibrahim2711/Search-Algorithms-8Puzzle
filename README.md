Search Algorithms in AI – 8 Puzzle Problem



Project Overview

This project focuses on using different Artificial Intelligence search algorithms

to solve the 8-Puzzle problem. The main objective is to reach the goal state

by applying several search techniques and comparing their performance.



Problem Description

The 8-Puzzle problem consists of a 3×3 grid that contains 8 numbered tiles

(from 1 to 8) and one empty space represented by 0.



The goal state of the puzzle is:



1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 0



Implemented Algorithms

The following search algorithms are implemented in this project:

\- Breadth First Search (BFS)

\- Depth First Search (DFS)

\- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

\- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)

\- A\* Search using Manhattan Distance heuristic

\- Hill Climbing algorithm



Technologies Used

\- Programming Language: C#

\- Framework: .NET Framework

\- Application Type: Console Application



How to Run the Project

1\. Open the project in Visual Studio

2\. Build the solution

3\. Run the program using Ctrl + F5

4\. Choose a search algorithm from the menu

5\. The solution path, number of steps, and execution time will be displayed



Sample Output

\- The solution path printed step by step

\- Total number of steps to reach the goal

\- Execution time in milliseconds



Performance Notes

\- BFS and UCS always find the optimal solution but require more memory

\- DFS uses less memory but does not always find the shortest path

\- IDS combines the advantages of BFS and DFS

\- A\* search with Manhattan Distance is faster and more efficient

\- Hill Climbing is fast but may get stuck in local optima
