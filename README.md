 Search Algorithms in AI – 8 Puzzle Problem

 Overview

This project applies several **Artificial Intelligence search algorithms** to solve the **8-Puzzle problem**.
The algorithms are compared based on **solution optimality**, **number of explored states**, and **execution time**.

---

 Problem Description

The 8-Puzzle consists of a **3×3 grid** with eight numbered tiles and one empty space (0).
Tiles move by sliding into the empty position.

**Initial State**

```
1 2 3
4 0 6
7 5 8
```

**Goal State**

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 0
```

 Implemented Algorithms

* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* A* Search (Manhattan Distance)
* Hill Climbing

 State Representation

* Puzzle state stored as a **1D array of 9 elements**
* `0` represents the empty space
* States are generated by valid moves (up, down, left, right)
* Each state stores a reference to its parent to reconstruct the solution path

 Heuristic Function

**Manhattan Distance** is used to estimate the distance of each tile from its goal position.
It improves performance by reducing explored states, especially in **A*** search.

Performance Summary

| Algorithm      | Optimal | Notes                  |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| BFS            | Yes     | High memory usage      |
| DFS            | No      | Low memory, unreliable |
| A* (Manhattan) | Yes     | Best performance       |
| Hill Climbing  | No      | Fast but may get stuck |
